### Welcome to my github profile
Hello there! The goal of my profile is just to share some of my work on GUIs and Dashboards and such, mainly using Python PySide library.
I have been passionate about programming since a relatively young age and got into C, C++ and Java when I was studying at the University.
As of today, I am working in data analysis and Python has been my goto language just for the sake of its simplicity and the multitude of useful modules and libraries. Despite being labelled as a "slow" language, I believe many applications in this field (data analysis) do not require such a high degree of efficiency and should do just fine, especially with high performing machines readily available for so many people worldwide.

The very first tutorial I followed to get on board with Python was the "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart, that I cannot recommend enough (either book or videos). It was free on Udemy at that time so I just dove into in and was just facinated by the possibilities of this language.

### Inspirations
I have been heavily influenced by the work of [Wanderson](https://github.com/Wanderson-Magalhaes), so credit where credit is due. Many other ideas come either from some tutorials on Youtube or with trial and error on my own (StackOerflow obv).
