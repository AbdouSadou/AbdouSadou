### Welcome to my github profile
Hello there! The goal of my profile is just to share some of my projects that interest me on dashboards, data analysis and machine learning tools, mainly using Python.
I have been passionate about programming since a relatively young age and got into C, C++ and Java when I was studying.
As of today, I am working in data analysis, with Python being my goto language just for the sake of its simplicity and the multitude of useful modules and libraries. Despite being labelled as a "slow" language, I believe many applications in this field do not require such a high degree of efficiency and should do just fine, especially with high performing machines readily available for so many people worldwide.

The very first tutorial I followed to get on board with Python was the "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart, that I cannot recommend enough, check the free book [here](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). The video course was free on Udemy (check if it still is [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/automate/)) at that time, so I just dove into in and was just facinated by the endless possibilities.

### Inspirations
For my dashboards and pyqt design, I have been heavily influenced by the work of [Wanderson](https://github.com/Wanderson-Magalhaes), so credit where credit is due. Many other ideas come either from various online tutorials, with trial and error on my own or with a mix of everything (StackOverflow ftw!).
